## About the Game

The game is a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. 

The game is build with HTML, CSS and JavaScipt.

## How To Play The Game

You are to flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match.
Follow these steps to play the game:

1. Flips one card over by clicking the card to reveal its underlying symbol.
2. Then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
3. If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
4. If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
5. The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
